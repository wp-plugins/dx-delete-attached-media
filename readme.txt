Automatically deletes attached media from posts and custom post types added via the Media button.

== Description ==

DX Delete Attached Media deletes all attached media files to posts once they get deleted from the system. The standard core behavior deletes posts alone without taking care of related images. Now you can maintain your install and get rid of all solo attachments getting into your posts via the Media button and used nowhere else.

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'dx-delete-attached-media' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory or find via the Plugins admin section
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's all. It would use out of the box, no settings needed. If you want to disable the functionality, disable the plugin from the Plugins section.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
